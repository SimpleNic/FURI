<p>This is a project for the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative at Arizona State University.</p>
<p>This project aims to predict the public’s opinion on any given pop music using a machine learning model and the music’s audio features. While other studies have been shown to predict public ratings of pop music, those studies only used the metadata, such as the music’s artist and album. By using audio features instead of only metadata to predict public opinions on music, this project will help musical artists without much previous musical data to understand how their pop music will be received and allow them to improve their music before they publish it.</p>

<p>Spotify would regularly update their music so I ended up using this set of music from March 9, 2023 for the rest of the project.</p><br>
<p>A Gaussian Mixture Model is used to split the tracks into groups based on the AIC and BIC scores</p>

<p>Here a split into two, three, or four groups can be done.<br> I went with a split of two groups as shown below.</p>
